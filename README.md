# MicroFilters
The First public repository For the MicroFilters project

MicroFilters is a disaster management system recently published in the IEEE Global Humanitarian Technologies Conference, the paper for which can be found [here](http://microfilter.cs.uwaterloo.ca/Andrew/ResearchPics/MicroFiltersCameraReady.pdf), hosted on my personal website. For the IEEEXplore page, see [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970316&queryText%3DMicroFilters).

#Note

This is the first release of the MicroFilters platform, and as such, it is quite unpolished. Polishing and refining the project will be done over the following weeks and months.

#Liscence
This code/software is free to use or edit, but I'd really appreciate it if attribution was given.
